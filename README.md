**Webapp** is the main public-facing web application to allow user to contribute metadata about content that has been crawled & archived from [Data Together](http://datatogether.org). Beta code runs on [archivers.co](https://archivers.co) and production code on [datatogether.org](https://datatogether.org).

## Getting Involved

We would love involvement from more people! If you notice any errors or would like to submit changes, please see our [Contributing Guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We use GitHub issues for [tracking bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/datatogether/webapp/issues) and Pull Requests (PRs) for [submitting changes](https://github.com/datatogether/webapp/pulls).

## Installation

To get started with dev, make sure you have [docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) And then run:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:datatogether/webapp.git
$ cd webapp
$ docker-compose up
```

This'll spin up a whole bunch of servers and make lots of noise. Once you see `webpack built` you can go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running locally.

## Development

Developing is as simple as editing files in source. If webpack can, it'll automatically recompile & update your browser window. Have the browser's console open to make sure nothing's exploding.

### Technologies

* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux Framework](https://redux.js.org/)
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

### Project Organization

* `src/js/actions/` - everything the app can "do"
* `src/js/components/` - react.js components
* `src/js/containers/` - "smart" react.js components that read data from the redux state object
* `src/js/middleware/` - middleware intercepts fired-off actions, performing tasks like API calls & logging
* `src/js/propTypes/` - react.js propType definitions for reuse around the app
* `src/js/reducers/` - redux reducers that map actions to
* `src/js/selectors/` - functions that pull computed logic out of state
* `src/js/store/` - redux store configuration
* `src/js/validators/` - validation logic that checks models, returning error message validation objects
